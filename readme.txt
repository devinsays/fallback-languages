== Description ==

If translations are not available for a specific language locale, this plugin will attempt to load alternate translation locales in the same language before falling back to English.  For example, if the language locale is es_MX (Spanish - Mexico) and no translations are available, WordPress will look for other Spanish translations (such es_ES, etc.) before displaying the default language of the theme or plugin.
